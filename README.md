# EasyChic
EasyChic is taken from the English “easy” and “chic” which is inspired by the concept of an application that we will design with the vision of helping consumers look chic very easily with just one click. In addition, EasyChic aims to support the growth and development of SMEs and make it easier for consumers to buy clothes through the e-commerce business model.

## Machine Learning
In EasyChic application we create a content-based recommendation system. The model will predict the products that will be recommended based on the user's preferences.
